## Prerequisites:

-> You have Anaconda already installed in your system

-> conda package manager is installed

-> pip is installed correctly, make sure you check step  1 and 2 of trouble shoot for correct pip installation 

->Downloading data from kaggle: 
  https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data 

  Download all data from above url and extract it in data folder, your final data package should contain below list of file:

  googletrend.csv, state_names.csv, store.csv, store_states.csv, test.csv, train.csv, weather.csv, sample_submission.csv


## Project setup: 

cd into Rossmann-Store-Sales-Kaggle-Competition folder 

-> sudo conda env update -f environment-cpu.yml 

The above command creates a environment "fastai-cpu-dev" in your anaconda.

for activating newly creating environment:

-> source activate fastai-cpu-dev


## Opening Jupyter notebook

run "jupyter notebook" in your fast-ai-cpu environment, it will look something like this:

## Trouble Shooting

conda install -c anaconda bcolz

### Steps to make your pip default to anaconda environment:

-> sudo conda install pip 

now check again pip install folder:
-> which pip

it should come something like: /Users/setup/anaconda3/bin/pip
